<h2>Adult Hockey League for all Experience Levels!</h2>
<p style= "text-align: center;">The Flagler Hockey league is a fun league designed for anyone that wants to play some hockey! We currently have four teams and are always looking to expand. It is free to come down and play a game to see if this league is for you before signing up. We only require that you sign a waiver for insurance reasons. Flagler Hockey is located right next to the Flagler Highschool in Palm Coast, Florida.</p>
